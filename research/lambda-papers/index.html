<h1>The Lambda Papers</h1>

	<p>Papers by Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman published as AI Memos
		by the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory between
		December 1975 and March 1979.</p>
	<p>As noted in <a href="https://standards.scheme.org/early/">Early standards</a>, 
		the tone of these papers is relatively informal and their typesetting targetted 1970s
		computer printing technology. </p>
	<p>HTML and PDF transcriptions with links are now available,
		in addition to the MIT scans of original printed copies (<a href="#note1">Note 1</a>)</p>

	[<a href="lambda-papers-scheme-report.html">HTML</a>, 
	 <a href="lambda-papers-scheme-report.pdf">PDF</a>] (<a href="#note2">Note 2</a>)
	<blockquote>
		"Inspired by ACTORS, we have implemented an interpreter for a LISP-like language, 
	  SCHEME, based on the lambda calculus, but extended for side effects, multiprocessing, and 
	  process synchronization..." 
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Steele, Guy L and Sussman, Gerald Jay. 
	<strong>LAMBDA: The Ultimate Imperative</strong>. AIM-353, March 1976. 
	[<a href="lambda-papers-ltu-imperative-extract.html">HTML</a>, 
	 <a href="lambda-papers-ltu-imperative-extract.pdf">PDF</a>]
	<blockquote>
		"We demonstrate how to model the following common programming constructs in terms of an 
		applicative order language similar to LISP: - Simple Recursion - Iteration - Compound 
		Statements and Expressions - GO TO and Assignment - Continuation-Passing - Escape 
		Expressions - Fluid Variables - Call by Name, Call by Need, and Call by Reference..."
  </blockquote></p>
		
<p>Steele, Guy L. <strong>LAMBDA The Ultimate Declarative</strong>. AIM-379, November 1976. 
	[<a href="lambda-papers-ltu-declarative.html">HTML</a>, 
	 <a href="lambda-papers-ltu-declarative.pdf">PDF</a>]
	<blockquote>
		"In this paper, a sequel to LAMBDA: The Ultimate Imperative, a new view of LAMBDA as a 
		renaming operator is presented and contrasted with the usual functional view taken by 
		LISP..."
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Steele, Guy L. <strong>Compiler Optimization Based on Viewing LAMBDA as RENAME plus GOTO
</strong>. May 1977.
	[<a href="lambda-papers-compiler-optimization.html">HTML</a>, 
	 <a href="lambda-papers-compiler-optimization.pdf">PDF</a>] (<a href="#note3">Note 3</a>)
	<blockquote>
    "We have developed a compiler for the lexically-scoped dialect of LISP known as SCHEME. 
		The compiler knows relatively little about specific data manipulation primitives such as
	  arithmetic operators, but concentrates on general issues of environment and control..."
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Steele, Guy L. <strong>Debunking the "Expensive Procedure Call" Myth or, Procedure Call 
	Implementations Considered Harmful or, LAMBDA: The Ultimate GOTO</strong>. AIM-443, October 1977. 
	[<a href="lambda-papers-ltu-goto.html">HTML</a>, 
	 <a href="lambda-papers-ltu-goto.pdf">PDF</a>]
	<blockquote>
    "Folklore states that GOTO statements are "cheap", while procedure calls are "expensive". 
		This myth is largely a result of poorly designed language implementations..."	
  </blockquote></p>
	
<p>Steele, Guy L and Sussman, Gerald Jay. 
	<strong>The Revised Report on SCHEME A Dialect of LISP</strong>. AIM-452, January 1978.
  [<a href="lambda-papers-revised-report.html">HTML</a>, 
	 <a href="lambda-papers-revised-report.pdf">PDF</a>]
	<blockquote>
	  "SCHEME is a dialect of LISP. It is an expression-oriented, applicative order, 
		interpreter-based language which allows one to manipulate programs as data..."
  </blockquote></p>

<p>Sussman, Gerald Jay and Steele, Guy L. <strong>The Art of the Interpreter or, The 
	Modularity Complex (Parts Zero, One, and Two)</strong>. AIM-453, May 1978. 
  [<a href="lambda-papers-interpreter.html">HTML</a>, 
	 <a href="lambda-papers-interpreter.pdf">PDF</a>]
	<blockquote>
    "We examine the effects of various language design decisions on the programming styles 
		available to a user of the language, with particular emphasis on the ability to 
		incrementally construct modular systems. At each step we exhibit an interactive 
		meta-circular interpreter for the language under consideration..."

	<blockquote>
    "We have developed a compiler for the lexically-scoped dialect of LISP known as SCHEME.

  [<a href="lambda-papers-ltu-opcode/ltu8-opcode.html">HTML</a>, 
	 <a href="lambda-papers-ltu-opcode/ltu8-opcode.pdf">PDF</a>]
	<blockquote>
    "We present a design for a class of computers whose 'instruction sets' are based on LISP. 
		LISP, like traditional stored-program machine languages and unlike most high-level 
		languages, conceptually stores programs and data in the same way and explicitly allows 
		programs to be manipulated as data. LISP is therefore a suitable language around which 
		to design a stored-program computer architecture..."
